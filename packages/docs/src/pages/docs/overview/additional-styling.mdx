# Additional Styling

import { Button } from '@micode-ui/react';
import { HeroContainer } from '../../../components/HeroContainer.tsx';
import { ButtonAdditionalStylingDemo } from '../../../demos/components/ButtonAdditionalStylingDemo.tsx';

It is just like: "If you want something done right, do it by yourself".

Jokes aside, with Micode UI you can extend the base components and customize them freely.

All components can receive a prop called `css` which receives an object containing the css properties you already know.

### Example

```tsx
<Button
  css={{
    background: '#00875f',
    '&:not(:disabled):hover': {
      background: '#015f43'
    }
  }}
>
  Hello World!
</Button>
```

### Result

<HeroContainer>
  <ButtonAdditionalStylingDemo />
</HeroContainer>
